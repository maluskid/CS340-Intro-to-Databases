#CS340 Shared Repository
### Group 53: Dominic and Denyse

The command `git clone https://github.com/maluskid/CS340-Intro-to-Databases.git`
will initialize a git repository in your PWD that mirrors this one. I have yet
to manage a repository with more maintainers than just myself, so that will be an
interesting hurdle to cross. I'll look into setting permissions so you don't need
to make merge requests to merge your code into the repository. It's possible you
could simply make a fork of this repository to have your own working one and I could
do the same, and we can merge when we need to into the group repository.
